# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Rental Marketplace Enhancement Project - User Requirements:
  1. Force login for all users (no guest browsing of properties)
  2. Role selection after login (Owner or Customer)
  3. Multiple property types: Rooms, Lodges, Houses, Apartments, Villas, Cottages, Farmhouses, Studios, PG, Hostels
  4. Owner can create property profiles with:
     - Property type, facilities, square feet, location
     - Google Maps link/coordinates
     - Multiple images
     - Detailed descriptions
  5. Customer can view all properties with filters
  6. Google Maps integration - clickable links that open Google Maps with directions
  7. Real-time chat between customers and property owners
  8. Owner can receive and reply to messages in inbox
  9. Keep existing frontend design unchanged

      ========== FIX APPLIED: LOGIN FLOW CORRECTED ==========
      Date: Current session
      
      ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
      - Role selection was being prompted on every login
      - Owner needed direct access to add property form after login
      - Customer needed direct access to listings page after login
      
      FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
      1. Updated LoginPage.jsx - Now redirects based on user role:
         - If role not set → /select-role (one-time only)
         - If role = OWNER → /owner/dashboard
         - If role = CUSTOMER → /listings
      
      2. Updated AuthContext.jsx - Login function now returns user data
      
      3. Updated RoleSelectionPage.jsx - After role selection:
         - OWNER → Redirected to /owner/add-listing (to add first property)
         - CUSTOMER → Redirected to /listings (to browse properties)
      
      FLOW NOW:
      ✅ First Time Owner: Register → Select "Owner" → Add Property Page
      ✅ Returning Owner Login: Login → Dashboard (with existing properties)
      ✅ First Time Customer: Register → Select "Customer" → Listings Page
      ✅ Returning Customer Login: Login → Listings Page
      ✅ Role is saved permanently in database (cannot be changed)
      
      All properties added by owners are visible to customers in /listings page.
